  description: Maps model keypoint indices to pitch vertex indices
# Keypoint mapping for custom YOLO field detection model
# Maps your model's keypoint indices to pitch vertex indices
# Only needed if use_custom_field_detection is true
  mapping:
    # Example mapping - adjust based on your model's training:
    0: 0    # Model keypoint 0 -> Pitch corner (top-left)
    1: 1    # Model keypoint 1 -> Pitch corner (top-right)
    2: 2    # Model keypoint 2 -> Pitch corner (bottom-right)
    3: 3    # Model keypoint 3 -> Pitch corner (bottom-left)
    4: 4    # Model keypoint 4 -> Center circle
    5: 5    # Model keypoint 5 -> Penalty area left
    6: 6    # Model keypoint 6 -> Penalty area right
    7: 7    # Model keypoint 7 -> Halfway line
    8: 8    # Model keypoint 8 -> Goal left
    9: 9    # Model keypoint 9 -> Goal right
    10: 10  # Model keypoint 10 -> Center spot
    11: 11  # Model keypoint 11 -> Corner left
    12: 12  # Model keypoint 12 -> Corner right
    13: 13  # Model keypoint 13 -> Goal area left
    14: 14  # Model keypoint 14 -> Goal area right
    15: 15  # Model keypoint 15 -> Penalty spot left
    16: 16  # Model keypoint 16 -> Penalty spot right
    17: 17  # Model keypoint 17 -> Halfway line center
    18: 18  # Model keypoint 18 -> Center circle edge
    19: 19  # Model keypoint 19 -> Penalty area left edge
    20: 20  # Model keypoint 20 -> Penalty area right edge
    21: 21  # Model keypoint 21 -> Goal area left edge
    22: 22  # Model keypoint 22 -> Goal area right edge
    23: 23  # Model keypoint 23 -> Corner left edge
    24: 24  # Model keypoint 24 -> Corner right edge
    25: 25  # Model keypoint 25 -> Goal left edge
    26: 26  # Model keypoint 26 -> Goal right edge
    27: 27  # Model keypoint 27 -> Penalty spot left edge
    28: 28  # Model keypoint 28 -> Penalty spot right edge
    29: 29  # Model keypoint 29 -> Halfway line center edge
    30: 30  # Model keypoint 30 -> Center circle edge left
    31: 31  # Model keypoint 31 -> Center circle edge right
    # Add more mappings as needed for penalty areas, center circle, etc.
    # Run keypoint_mapping_helper.py to visualize and create proper mapping
